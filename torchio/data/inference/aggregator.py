class GridAggregator:
    r"""Aggregate patches for dense inference.

    This class is typically used to build a volume made of patches after
    inference of batches extracted by a :py:class:`~torchio.data.GridSampler`.

    Args:
        sampler: Instance of :py:class:`~torchio.data.GridSampler` used to
            extract the patches.
        overlap_mode: If ``'crop'``, the overlapping predictions will be
            cropped. If ``'average'``, the predictions in the overlapping areas
            will be averaged with equal weights. See the
            `grid aggregator tests`_ for a raw visualization of both modes.
