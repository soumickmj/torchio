class GridSampler(PatchSampler, Dataset):
    r"""Extract patches across a whole volume.

    Grid samplers are useful to perform inference using all patches from a
    volume. It is often used with a :py:class:`~torchio.data.GridAggregator`.

    Args:
        sample: Instance of :py:class:`~torchio.data.subject.Subject`
            from which patches will be extracted.
        patch_size: Tuple of integers :math:`(w, h, d)` to generate patches
            of size :math:`w \times h \times d`.
            If a single number :math:`n` is provided,
            :math:`w = h = d = n`.
        patch_overlap: Tuple of even integers :math:`(w_o, h_o, d_o)` specifying
            the overlap between patches for dense inference. If a single number
            :math:`n` is provided, :math:`w_o = h_o = d_o = n`.
        padding_mode: Same as :attr:`padding_mode` in
            :py:class:`~torchio.transforms.Pad`. If ``None``, the volume will
            not be padded before sampling and patches at the border will not be
            cropped by the aggregator. Otherwise, the volume will be padded with
            :math:`\left(\frac{w_o}{2}, \frac{h_o}{2}, \frac{d_o}{2} \right)`
            on each side before sampling. If the sampler is passed to a
            :py:class:`~torchio.data.GridAggregator`, it will crop the output
            to its original size.
