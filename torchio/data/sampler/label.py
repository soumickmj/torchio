class LabelSampler(WeightedSampler):
    r"""Extract random patches with labeled voxels at their center.

    This sampler yields patches whose center value is greater than 0
    in the :py:attr:`label_name`.

    Args:
        patch_size: See :py:class:`~torchio.data.PatchSampler`.
        label_name: Name of the label image in the sample that will be used to
            generate the sampling probability map. If ``None``, the first image
            of type :py:attr:`torchio.LABEL` found in the subject sample will be
            used.
        label_probabilities: Dictionary containing the probability that each
            class will be sampled. Probabilities do not need to be normalized.
            For example, a value of ``{0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1}`` will create a
            sampler whose patches centers will have 50% probability of being
            labeled as ``1``, 25% of being ``2`` and 25% of being ``3``.
            If ``None``, the label map is binarized and the value is set to
            ``{0: 0, 1: 1}``.
            If the input has multiple channels, a value of
            ``{0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1}`` will create a
            sampler whose patches centers will have 50% probability of being
            taken from a non zero value of channel ``1``, 25% from channel
            ``2`` and 25% from channel ``3``.

    Example:
        >>> import torchio
        >>> subject = torchio.datasets.Colin27()
        >>> subject
        Colin27(Keys: ('t1', 'head', 'brain'); images: 3)
        >>> sample = torchio.SubjectsDataset([subject])[0]
        >>> sampler = torchio.data.LabelSampler(64, 'brain')
        >>> generator = sampler(sample)
        >>> for patch in generator:
        ...     print(patch.shape)

    If you want a specific number of patches from a volume, e.g. 10:

        >>> generator = sampler(sample, num_patches=10)
        >>> for patch in iterator:
        ...     print(patch.shape)
